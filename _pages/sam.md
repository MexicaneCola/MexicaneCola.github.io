<!-- I grew up in a small town in eastern NC. My wife and I now live in Cambridge, MA and have loved every construction-filled minute of it. -->

When I'm not working you can find me:
* Cooking / eating
* Running
* Cycling
* Playing guitar
* Losing to my mom in fantasy football
* Traveling and exploring
* Eating some more
* Programming
