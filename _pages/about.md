My name is Sam and I'm a fifth-year accounting PhD student at The MIT Sloan School of Management.

I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Accounting from Brigham Young University. I became interested in financial markets from a young age when an uncle of mine challenged me to create a fake investment portfolio on Investopedia. I imagine I was quite the sight to see - a 12-year old clicking through Yahoo! Finance financial data - however, since then, I have always been interested in understanding the usefulness of accounting information.

My research interests center on the intersection between accounting and finance. My current work explores the use of accounting information and corporate disclosures by various stakeholders and its effects on capital markets, as well as firms' economic decisions. 

In my job market paper, I study whether mispricing drives investors to consume accounting information. I find this question quite interesting given that one of the major roles of accounting information is to aid in valuation. Thus, as prices deviate from fundamental value, the usefulness of accounting information to investors increases significantly. To learn more about my study and what I find, I encourage you to take a look at my most recent draft which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1VNkp8YAgi2dhVZYNYet7-BMaKC3z_yst) as well as on my research page.

Some topics that I hope to explore in the future include the role of corporate disclosures in managing climate and sustainability efforts as well as the use of accounting information by less traditional stakeholders such as consumers and employees. I am very interested in the risks posed by climate change as well as the movement towards sustainability and inclusion. Given the increasing supply and access of accounting information as well as the rapidly evolving regulatory and disclosure landscape with respect to climate goals, I feel that research on these topics is compelling and has the potential to answer questions of economic significance.
