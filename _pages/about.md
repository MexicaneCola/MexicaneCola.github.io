My name is Sam and I'm a fifth-year accounting PhD student at the MIT Sloan School of Management. I am on the 2021-2022 academic job market. Prior to joining the accounting group at MIT, I received my bachelor's and master's degree in accounting from Brigham Young University.

<!-- I became interested in financial markets from a young age when an uncle of mine challenged me to create a fake investment portfolio on Investopedia. I imagine I was quite the sight to see - a 12-year old clicking through Yahoo! Finance financial data - however, since then, I have always been interested in understanding the usefulness of accounting information. -->

<!-- My current work explores the usefulness of accounting information across various stakeholders and its impact on capital markets.  -->
<!-- Broadly speaking, I'm interested in understanding (1) how various stakeholders use accounting information and its impact on capital markets and (2) how corporate disclosures affect both traditional and non-traditional stakeholders. -->

Broadly speaking, I'm interested in (1) how investors and other stakeholders learn from accounting reports and its impact on market outcomes and (2) the forces that shape firmsâ€™ disclosures as well as the role of accounting and other non-financial disclosures with respect to both corporate and macroeconomic sustainability efforts. 

In my dissertation, I study whether mispricing drives investors to consume accounting information. I find this question quite interesting given that one of the major roles of accounting is to aid in valuation, and yet, its ability to do so depends largely on its consumption. To learn more about my study and what I find, I encourage you to take a look at a recent draft which can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QtMngUXHwwz59vtjB0F0o2x9LzHYonaH/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.
