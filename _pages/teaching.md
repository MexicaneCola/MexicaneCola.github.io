Effective teaching can have a lasting, and meaningful, impact. I look forward to connecting with students, building an intuititon for accounting principles, and bringing interesting insights from research into the classroom and feel that my experiences and skillset are well-suited to the task. My primary teaching interests lie in financial accounting and financial statement analysis; however, I am comfortable teaching a wide range of undergraduate and graduate level accounting courses.
