### *"Mispricing and the Demand for Fundamental Information"* (JMP)
Summary: I provide evidence that mispricing affects investors' consumption of accounting information. Using quasi-exogenous variation in security prices due to forced mutual fund sales, I find that mispricing increases the consumption of accounting reports in subsequent periods, especially among institutional investors. I also find that information consumption following shocks to mispricing predicts both the size and speed of return reversals as well as price informativeness around future earnings events. Taken together, my findings suggest that mutual fund flow-induced mispricing shapes investors' information consumption decisions and that this consumption predicts the path of price discovery for mispriced firms.

<!-- Summary: I examine whether mispricing drives investors to consume accounting information. I find that mutual fund flow-induced mispricing increases the consumption of accounting information, especially among sophisticated investors. In addition, I find that information consumption following mutual fund fire sales predicts both the extent to which prices return to pre-fire sale levels as well as the speed of return reversals. These findings suggest that mispricing increases the demand for fundamental information contained in accounting reports and highlight the role of accounting information in the path of price discovery for mispriced firms. -->

### *"Costly Contract Renegotiation: The Role of Accounting Disclosures"* with Joe Weber and Jieying Zhang
Summary: We examine whether required disclosure of covenant violations affects the timing and extent to which debt contracts are renegotiated. Consistent with firms seeking to avoid disclosing a debt contract violation, we find that firms are three times more likely to agree to an amendment in the week before the end of the fiscal quarter. Moreover, we find that these renegotiations shift bargaining power to the lender such that they extract concessions from the borrower.

### *"The Information Content of Discretionary Disaggregation"*
Summary: I analyze firmsâ€™ decisions to disaggregate financial statement line items into their component parts and whether this is related to firm performance. I find that the overall level of discretionary disaggregation is positively associated with both current and future performance, but that changes in discretionary disaggregation are negatively associated with performance. Together these findings provide preliminary evidence consistent with the idea that firms use disaggregation to manage the information environment.

<!-- ### Future Work

Some topics that I hope to explore in the future include the role of corporate disclosures in managing climate and sustainability efforts as well as the use of accounting information by less traditional stakeholders such as consumers and employees. I am very interested in the risks posed by climate change as well as the movement towards sustainability and inclusion. Given the increasing supply and access of accounting information as well as the rapidly evolving regulatory and disclosure landscape with respect to climate goals, I feel that research on these topics is compelling and has the potential to answer questions of economic significance. -->
